<h1 align=center>Plans on the development of Termml </h1>
Currently, the plan for the project is an alternative the traditional web browsers and markdown (ex: html, css, js, Chrome). In which Termml would be much lighter, faster and more optimized </br>

## Elements of the project
* ["renderer"](#termml-renderer)
* * [Termml (Markup)](#termmarkup)
* * [TSS (Style sheet)](#termstylesheet)
* * [TermSC (Scripting)](#termscripting)
* [navigator/browser](#navigator)
* [protocol of choice](#protocol)
* [hosting/server](#hostingserver)


### Termml renderer 
seperated crate being worked on, possible with cargo workspaces
this would be modular, other people would be able to develop
their own renderer or browser environment that would be using 
termml's parser 

### Navigator

### protocol 
standard http or any protocol that could transfer small files 

### hosting/server
same as above

### TermMarkUp

### TermStyleSheet

### TermScripting
